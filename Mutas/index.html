  <h1>Mutas - A Modular Tabletop Role-Playing Game</h1>
  <p>
    Mutas is my custom pen and paper roleplaying game.
	It is very much still in development and can be found on github <a href = "https://github.com/Sionth/Mutas">here</a>.
	What I mean by modular is that I am designing it such that players can make it complex or simple in the ways that are interesting to them.
    Admittedly, this does mean designing the some of the sub-systems multiple times, but that is part of the charm.
    It also means that I don't have decide on a single correct way because players can choose their own version of correctness.
	I, instead, present the simplest version of the rules as basic and list others later as optional replacements for more depth etc.
