  <h1>Mutas - A Modular Tabletop Role-Playing Game</h1>
  <p>
    Modular in that I am designing it so that players can make it complex or simple in the ways that are interesting to them.
    Admittedly, this does mean designing the some of the sub-systems multiple times, but that is part of the charm.
    In a way it also means that I don't have decide what the correct way is because players can choose their own version of correctness.
