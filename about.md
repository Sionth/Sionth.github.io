# My Background
I recieved my Bachelor of Science from University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, USA.
Here I majored in physics but learned an appreciation for a vareity of subjects with one of my favourites being the interactions of Science, Technology, and Society.
After this I continued my physics journey at University of Oregon (Eugene, OR, USA) where I recieved a Master of Science in applied physics with emphasis on optical materials and devices.
I like to (over)simplify this as studying lasers and laser accessories.
In the process of obtaining this degree I learned that knowledge of programming was becoming increasingly important toprcaticing physicists.
This, combined with a prior interest in computing technology, led me to attend classes at University of Otago (Dunedin, NZ) in order to obtain a Diploma for Graduates endorsed with Computer Science.
This single year course was designed to be the functional equivalent of a major and, for the most part, I think this is accurate.
I took the full course instead of simply working on projects on my own because if it's worth doing it's worth doing correctly.

# My interests
Beyond my academic interests outlined above I'm also interested in various forms of games.
In particular I am interested in old-school style pen and paper role-playing games such as Shadowrun and Traveller.
