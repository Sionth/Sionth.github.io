# My Background
I recieved my Bachelor of Science from University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, USA.
Here I majored in physics but learned an appreciation for a vareity of subjects with one of my favourites being the interactions of Science, Technology, and Society.

After this I continued my physics journey at University of Oregon where I recieved a Master of Science in applied physics with emphasis on optical materials and devices.
I like to (over)simplify this as study of lasers and laser accessories.
