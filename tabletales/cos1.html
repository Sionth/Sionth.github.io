<h1>Barovian Rhapsody -  D&D 5e, Curse of Strahd</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	In this campaign I serve as the dungeon master for a group of 6 exploring the lands of Barovia in Curse of Strahd.
	My players wanted to check out 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons and I was curious about the adventure itself.
	It has been a very interesting experience for me as it has been the longest running campaign I've been a part of, let alone running, so I've learned quite a bit!
	One note, however, I started this campaign a several months before beginning to write this up.
	I will do my best to recreate events as I remember them but there will, most likely, be a sudden increase in detail as you read through.

<h3>A Visit from Vasili von Holtz</h3>
<p>
	With both Aelar and Kasimir laid low after their investigation into Argynvostholt the party sets out to return to the abbott back at the Abbey of Saint Markovia in the hopes of of raising them both with their two remaining favours from the abbott.
	They make quick time with Sol's transformation into a giant elk.
	They are interrupted at the first fork in the road when Ezmerelda, guarding the party's rear, takes a few arrows.
	None strike any vital areas and she is able to point out the assailants to the rest of the party and they easily take them down.
</p>
<p>
	As they near Krezk they notice somewhat conspicuous black carriage waiting on the road outside the gates.
	It appears to be empty and the horses attached are busying themselves with grazing.
	Sol calls out to them, still in his elk form, to which he gets a glare and a snort.
	The party decides to avoid the carriage and hurry up to the abbey.
