## Welcome to my website source
I am writing it entirely in HTML and CSS for the sake of control and understanding what is going on under the hood.
With that said, I am still using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to keep things somewhat tidy and because it's what github uses to generate the website.
I have also used the Github pages/Jekyll theme [Hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) as a starting point for my own theming.
