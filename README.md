## Welcome to my website source
I am writing it entirely in HTML and CSS for the sake of control and understanding what is going on under the hood.
With that said, I am still using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to keep things somewhat tidy and because it's what github uses to generate the website.
