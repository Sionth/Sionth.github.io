<h2> Discussion </h2>
<h3> How I plan to use this </h3>
<p>
	One thing that I keep coming back to regarding this website is how I want to use it; what function will it serve for me.
	The first, most obvious, use I have for it is as a long form resume/curriculum vita.
	You can see that I have done this on the home page of the website.
</p>


<h2> Future Plans </h2>
<h4> Projects page layout </h4>
<p>
	One of the things that jekyll lets you do is make layouts that can be used as templates such that you don't need to redo all of the common features, such as headers, that most, if not all, of the pages on the site will need done identically.
	As of writing, I only have one layout.
	I think that I have enough projects that I want to ist and discuss that a projects layout is warranted.
</p>
<p>
	A possible extension of this, that I seriously plan to implement, is allowing each project page to function as a TODO-list of immediate next steps as well as context for what I have already done and overall direction I would like to take it in.
	All of this in addition to the general discussion of things that I have learned along the way.
	This comes from me wanting, for quite a long time, a way to keep track of my varioous projects and how to advance them in arbitrary detail.
	This last part, arbitrary detail, has been what has stymied me with other projects.
	In future I do still plan to make my own program to fit my needs (see <a href "rlquest.html">RLQuest</a>) but using my website for this allows me to keep track of these arbitrary details with little more effort than creating a document while also allowing people (or myself on multiple devices) to see where I am at, should that become useful.
</p>

<h4> Recipes Page </h4>
<p>
	Sometimes I have come up with interesting recipes that I want to share with my friends so it could be useful to have them easily available.
