	<p>
		I started work on Mutas in September 2019.
		Mutas is a tabletop role-playing game of my own devising based on my experiences in what does and doesn't work and what does and doesn't exist on the market.
		One of my goals with this project, in addition to making a game I would like to play, is to make a game that can have its depth of mechanics varied and thus be somewhat modular.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am designing it such that players can make it complex or simple in the ways that are interesting to them.
		Admittedly, this does mean designing the some of the sub-systems multiple times, but that is part of the charm.
		It also means that I don't have decide on a single correct way because players can choose their own version of correctness.
		I, instead, present the simplest version of the rules as basic and list others later as optional replacements for more depth etc.

<!--<h3>Hobobeau, June 2018 - Current</h3>
<p>
  Hobobeau started out as a silly idea to learn about game development with a couple friends.
  It is a visual novel about meeting new friends among the homeless of Central Park after losing everything in the Wall Street crash.
  We all, honestly, thought it would be something we'd power through, learn from, and enable to work on more technical and ambitious projects afterwards.
  But, as you can see from the dates worked, there was more to this than we initially thought.

<p>
  The goal of this project was to do something useful with the parts from an old laptop.
  This laptop had broken due to a fried motherboard after a grounding pin in the power supply broke off.
  Most of the peripheral components were still intact and thus useable for other means.
  The focus of this project, however, is the screen.
</p>
<p>
  I had seen articles from around the internet where people had used a cardboard box and a Fresnel lens to convert their phones or tablets into makeshift projectors to watch videos.
  Given that I had a, most likely, functional LCD screen left over from this laptop, I wanted to try to take this concept and improve upon it.
