  <h2>Laptop Projector</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to do something useful with the parts from an old laptop.
    This laptop had broken due to a fried motherboard after a grounding pin in the power supply broke off.

  <p>
    Mutas is a tabletop role-playing game of my own divising based on my experiences in what does and doesn't work and what does and doesn't exist on the market.
    One of my goals with this project, in addition to making a game I would like to play, is to make a game that can have its depth of mechanics varied and thus be a somewhat modular.
