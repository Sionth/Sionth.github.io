	<!-- ultimate in technical writing as it is one giant functional specification -> putting what I've learned to use -->
	<p>
		Mutas is a tabletop role-playing game of my own devising based on my experiences in what does and doesn't work and what does and doesn't exist on the market.
		One of my goals with this project, in addition to making a game I would like to play, is to make a game that can have its depth of mechanics varied and thus be somewhat modular.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am designing it such that players can make it complex or simple in the ways that are interesting to them.
		Admittedly, this does mean designing the some of the sub-systems multiple times, but that is part of the charm.
		It also means that I don't have decide on a single correct way because players can choose their own version of correctness.
		I, instead, present the simplest version of the rules as basic and list others later as optional replacements for more depth etc.

	<h4>Summary</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Worked with 2 other students to create a short tower defence game.</li>
		<li>Implemented Dijkstra/Flow maps for efficient path-finding</li>
		<li>Designed and revised the project's User Interface</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This was a project I worked on with two others over the course of 5 weeks.
		I have preserved the initial form of it <a href = "/projects/Alchemaster/">here</a> but you should also be able to view it on the course website <a href = "http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc360/game-projects-alchemaster.php">here</a>.
		Because the other two members of the group were proficient in different kinds of art I was one of the main programmers for the project.
		In particular I took responsibility for the behaviour of the enemies in the game with the pathfinding being easily one of the most interesting aspects.
		I also took partial responsibility for the User Interface design as I was the member of the group most experienced with the genre of game we were creating - tower defence - which also meant that I naturally was given partial responsibility for checking the balance of the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		The path-finding was interesting because the technique we had learned for path-finding was among the best for a low number of actors, especially when destinations needed to be recalculated frequently.
		This method, the A* method, has each actor probe possible moves, preferring the shortest path towards the target that it has thus far explored.
		I knew that we would have many many actors on the screen at once, meaning that any way to reduce their need to think would be greatly valuable.
		Further, our game had player-created mazes being constructed while enemies were moving towards a static goal location.
		The long mazes meant that there was a long path to calculate.
	</p>
	<p>
		The solution I arrived at, after discussing the project with a friend with greater experience in the field, was to use flow maps.
		In this case the map itself calculates the distance a given tile is from the goal.
		The downside is that the entirety of the map must be explored to determine its distance from the goal, but the upside is that this only needs to happen once per update.
		For enemies this is much faster since they simply need to look at the tiles adjacent to them and move towards the one with the lowest distance to the goal.
		An additional advantage to this technique is that it enabled us to tell if there were areas of the map that were blocked off thus impossible to navigate from.
		This allowed us to prevent actions that would cause this situation.

<h2>Woodworking</h2>
<button type = "button" class = "collapsible"><b>Guitar Stand</b></button>
<div class = "content">
	<img src = "/images/guitar_stand.jpg" alt = "My custom guitar stand." style = "width: 40%; float: left;">
	<div style = "float: right; width: 55%;"><p>
		I made this guitar stand in year 12 as my woodworking project.
		I started by researching what current trends were in guitar stand design, followed by taking measurements of my own guitar.
		With this I could sketch out potential designs.
		Once I was satisfied with the sketches I created a mock-up from wire to test my measurements, especially important given all the curves.
		With the mock-up adjusted as desired I traced it to make patterns for bending guides.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the guides were cut out I needed to co-ordinate with my teacher more than I had before in order to figure out the best way to bend wood into the desired shape.
		His suggestion was to use the lamination method; whereby several thin pieces of wood are bent, after being softened via boiling, at the same time then glued in shape and trimmed.
		This is the technique ultimately used, but it did necessitate him making something that we could boil several pieces of wood nearing 2 meters in length at the same time.
		His solution was a long vertical steel tube capped at one end and heated via camp stove.
		The bending and lamination process was repeated for each of the four pieces, each with their own guide and many clamps.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the main pieces constructed all that remained was the receiver for the guitar neck, the pads to protect the body of the guitar, and to connect it all together.
		The neck and back support were connected by drilling and chiselling slots and teeth.
		The others, including the pads, were connected via dowels made from a different wood for contrast.
		I made the pads using small thing blocks of wood, a section of suede fabric, and polyfill by placing the polyfill on the block and wrapping it with the suede before using a staple gun to affix the suede to the bottom of the block.
		The neck receiver, like the dowels, was made from a hard wood for contrast and durability.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, once everything was assembled and sanded smooth, I coated all of the wooden pieces with a couple layers of lacquer via spray-gun, sanding with high grit sand-paper between coats to remove burrs.

<!--<h3>Hobobeau</h3>
<p>
  Hobobeau started out as a silly idea to learn about game development with a couple friends.
  It is a visual novel about meeting new friends among the homeless of Central Park after losing everything in the Wall Street crash.
  We all, honestly, thought it would be something we'd power through, learn from, and enable to work on more technical and ambitious projects afterwards.
  But, as you can see from the dates worked, there was more to this than we initially thought.

<p>
  The goal of this project was to do something useful with the parts from an old laptop.
  This laptop had broken due to a fried motherboard after a grounding pin in the power supply broke off.
  Most of the peripheral components were still intact and thus useable for other means.
  The focus of this project, however, is the screen.
</p>
<p>
  I had seen articles from around the internet where people had used a cardboard box and a Fresnel lens to convert their phones or tablets into makeshift projectors to watch videos.
  Given that I had a, most likely, functional LCD screen left over from this laptop, I wanted to try to take this concept and improve upon it.
