  The first step in this was disassembling my old laptop in order to figure out what, exactly, I had to work with.
  I had initially tried doing research the exact parts list for my laptop through replacement part websites and the like, but was stymied by the fact that there was a later model of my laptop released under the same name.
  The back came off without much difficulty, after I had acquired the correct set of screwdriver heads, and I was able to see the internals of my laptop for the first time.

  In my research of my old laptop I had found teardown videos of similar models so could tell what, generally, I was looking for.
  I found the cables attaching the wireless antenna to the WiFi chip and the screen to the motherboard and, as carefully as I could, disconnected them.
  I was then able to removes the screws holding the hinges to the body of the laptop and finally separate the screen from the body.
  To get at the screen within its case I atually needed to wedge a guitar pick between the screen and the case and work it around until the snaps released.
  This revealed the screws holding the LCD and backlight assembly down.
  With these screws removed I could finally read the part number for the screen off the back and research the connector types required.

  This is when I discovered that I needed a dedicated control board to control the screen separately of the laptop, not just a microcontroller.
  One advantage to this is that it means that the final projector could be controlled in much the same way as an external monitor, requiring no special drivers to be installed or written.
  Finding a suitable one, however, proved challening in that most retailers I knew of did not stock this kind of product, let alone the specific one I needed.
  I was able to find one, with mixed reviews, that claimed compatibility with the screen I had and, finally, ordered it.
  Waiting for it to arrive forced me to return to other aspects of the build such as the general design.
