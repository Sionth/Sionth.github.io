title: Laptop Projector Project

<p>
  The first step in this was disassembling my old laptop in order to figure out what, exactly, I had to work with.
  I had initially tried doing research the exact parts list for my laptop through replacement part websites and the like, but was stymied by the fact that there was a later model of my laptop released under the same name.
  The back came off without much difficulty, after I had acquired the correct set of screwdriver heads, and I was able to see the internals of my laptop for the first time.

  In my research of my old laptop I had found tear-down videos of similar models so could tell what, generally, I was looking for.
  I found the cables attaching the wireless antenna to the WiFi chip and the screen to the motherboard and, as carefully as I could, disconnected them.
  I was then able to removes the screws holding the hinges to the body of the laptop and finally separate the screen from the body.
  To get at the screen within its case I actually needed to wedge a guitar pick between the screen and the case and work it around until the snaps released.
  This revealed the screws holding the LCD and backlight assembly down.
  With these screws removed I could finally read the part number for the screen off the back and research the connector types required.

  This is when I discovered that I needed a dedicated control board to control the screen separately of the laptop, not just a microcontroller.
  One advantage to this is that it means that the final projector could be controlled in much the same way as an external monitor, requiring no special drivers to be installed or written.
  Finding a suitable one, however, proved challenging in that most retailers I knew of did not stock this kind of product, let alone the specific one I needed.
  I was able to find one, with mixed reviews, that claimed compatibility with the screen I had and, finally, ordered it.
  Waiting for it to arrive forced me to return to other aspects of the build such as the general design.

  When the board arrived I rechecked the requirements on the power supply and went to town to find one.
  I was, for the most part, successful.
  I was able to find a well-fitting DC power supply unit at the appropriate voltage and current exceeding the specified minimum.
  Returning home, I connected up my components and was happy to find the screen displaying diagnostic information.
  When connected to a source by HDMI, however, there were some issues.
  This varied between showing but sometimes flickering and showing a constant signal of a black screen.

  After spending some investigating the source of the problem the results were inconclusive.
  The power supply was rated for 12 volts of direct current at up to 2.5 amps.
  The board specified that it required more than 2 amps, satisfied, and on the initial diagnostic it didn't flicker.
  With that said, it's possible that the addition of video input required a higher current draw than the power-supply could provide.
  This is somewhat countered by the backlight not flickering, only the display, during this time.
  Given this, it becomes likely that the issue is, instead, the board itself being faulty.
  If this were the case then there isn't much to be done.
  Yes, I could order a new one, but I only found the one supplier so there is no guarantee that the new one would work.
  Therefore I decided to put the project on hiatus until better information was available.
