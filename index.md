# Welcome!
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, I hope that you enjoy your stay.
If you'd like to learn a bit about me, be sure to check out the [about](about.md) page.
Otherwise, read on.

Here are some projects that I have worked on that you may find interesting:
* [Alchemaster](Alchemaster/Alchemaster_Old/index.html), a tower defense I, originally, made with classmates over the course of five weeks.
* An unnamed iOS [App](https://github.com/RobertGiles/App) for dealing with social anxiety that I helped to complete with another student for our full0year software engineering project.
