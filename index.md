# Welcome!
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, I hope that you enjoy your stay.
If you would like to contact me you may do so by email quinn.thorsnes@gmail.com.

If you'd like to learn a bit about me, be sure to check out the [about](about.md) page.
Otherwise, read on.

Here are some projects that I am currently working on:
* [Mutas](https://github.com/Sionth/Mutas) - A pen-and-paper roleplaying game with mechanics of my own devising.
<!--* [Prioritas](https://github.com/Sionth/Prioritas-Android), an Android app that will tell you what to work on next.
As it develops I plan to include more factors to base prioritization on, tools for team use, and, eventually, consider using machine learning such that the app tailors itself to the specific user.

And here are some that I have worked on that you may find interesting:
* [Alchemaster](Alchemaster/Alchemaster_Old/index.html), a tower defence I, originally, made with classmates over the course of five weeks.
My favourite part of this project was learning about and designing a pathing system that wouldn't cause performance strain when several enemies were present.
* An unnamed iOS [App](https://github.com/RobertGiles/App) for dealing with social anxiety that I helped to complete with another student for our full-year software engineering project.
* This guitar-stand made from laminated bent wood.
