  <h1>Hello, and welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Quinn.
    My interests are in technology generally but I am specifically educated in Physics and Computer science.
    If you'd like to read more about my background then feel free to check out my electronic CV by following the cv link at the top of the page.
    There is also a link to some of the projects I have worked on at the top of the page.
    Another place to find some of my projects is on my github page, a link to which is at the bottom of the page along with my email should you want to contact me directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website is also one of my projects and, as such, polish and content are still being added and experimented with.
    I appreciate your understanding.
  </p>
