      This masters program was designed with the goal of getting science graduates prepared for working in industry.
      They tried to do this by teaching skills desired by those in industry and the final portion of this took the form of a 9 month internship in place of a thesis.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
	  Here I was worked as a demonstrator for PHSI191: Biological Physics; a introductory physics paper required to be taken as part of the first year of health science at University of Otago.
	  The main difference between this teach laboratory experience and my previous is that those taking the class were doing so by requirement rather than preference.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Supported a quantum optics research group with their research</li>
      <li>Organised weekly literature review meetings by maintaining scheduling information on the group website and communicating with each week's speaker</li>
      <li>Recommended improvements to the existing cryostat design using physical models to compensate for missing information.</li>
      <li>Utilised SolidWorks to diagram and preview the changes required for these improvements</li>
      <li>Re-enabled use of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for experimentation on modern hardware by revising C++ code for Matlab integration.</li>
      <li>Measured the linewidth of an important laser to determine experimental precision</li>
      <li>Researched and advised on optical second harmonic generation materials and techniques for a specific product.</li>
      <li>Parsed 4 years of data from local SQL database using Matlab to generate plots for quick reference.</li>
      <li>Utilised Blender to diagram an experimental component for publication</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this position I had the opportunity to gain hands on experience with a variety of technologies related to research.
      It was also an exciting position in that it was the first time I was able to put the theory I had been learning into practical application.
      I was also able to, and expected to, learn various new technologies ancillary to the work being done.
      In many cases this was a result of delegation to enable other members of the group to focus on their research and other tasks unique to their abilities.
      Taking responsibility for organising the weekly literature review meetings of the group is one example of this.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Assisted in teaching 100-level physics laboratories while ensuring adherence to relevant safety protocols.</li>
      <li>Worked with 4 different lecturers to grade weekly homework assignments and laboratory reports.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
	  This was a position I took up while studying towards my Bachelor of Science at University of Puget Sound.
	  Here I worked with the professor teaching the class to make sure that the students were able to complete their laboratories safely while also ensuring that said students understood the experiments.
	  These laboratories were typically 5 tables of up to 6 students working together with widely varied academic backgrounds and experience levels.
	</p>
	<p>
	  One of the advantages to this arrangement is that I, as the teaching assistant, was able to practice explaining technical concepts and confirm what I needed to revise thus solidifying my knowledge.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoded self-reported demographic data for a child development study using NZ census classifications</li>
      <li>Transcribed parent-child conversation to better understand language development in young children.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My task in this position was to take open-ended data recorded in questionnaires by experiment participants and convert it into numerical data in a spreadsheet for those running the experiment.
      The open-ended data here was the job title participants reported themselves as having.
      These reported job titles were compared with those recorded in the New Zealand census, which also gave the relevant conversions to the numerical values desired by the experimenters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was interesting for me in that much of what I was doing was subject to interpretation.
      What this meant was that I had to learn about ways of ensuring that my interpretations of the given data would be the same as those that the experimenters themselves would have made.
      The main technique for this was each of us doing the same section of data and measuring the rate of agreement between us.
