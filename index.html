		This programme was designed to provide students that had already completed an undergraduate degree with the functional equivalent of a major in computer science.
		The programme took place over the course of just over a year; two summer semesters, a spring semester, and a fall semester.
		Personal highlights of the programme, for me, were the artificial intelligence paper that went over various common applications of machine learning and the game development and software engineering papers where I was able to learn more about the product development life-cycle.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think learning about the project development lifecycle, especially the advantages and disadvantages of various common approaches, was especially useful for me because this was not something I had formally engaged with since high school.

		This masters program was designed with the goal of getting science graduates prepared for working in industry.
		They tried to do this by teaching skills desired by those in industry and, in place of a thesis, three reports over the course of a nine-month internship.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my case I managed to organise a fixed-term research assistantship at the University of Otago in one of their quantum optics research groups.
		Details about this can be found later on this page.
		One of the key skills I developed here, in addition to learning various new technologies, was keeping intellectual property concerns in mind while writing my reports back to University of Oregon about what I was working on.

	<p>
		One of the things that made my time at UPS special was the requirement that we take classes outside of our majors.
		This took the form of taking two from a handful of papers during my first year as well as at least one paper from the categories of maths, physical sciences, social sciences, fine arts, and humanities.
		We also had a foreign language requirement and an upper division (300-level or higher) paper outside of our major.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the whole, I enjoyed this.
		The favourite subject this turned me onto was Science, Technology, and Society.
		As the name implies, the STS department were interested in the roles that science and technology take in society and their influence on its development.
		The papers I took focused the history of science and its controversies.

		This position saw me providing generalised assistance to the school's administrator during the busy end of year period.
		My duties ranged quite a bit; from helping students with plasters when they became injured to proofreading and editing end of year reports to be sent home with parents.
		My most common duty was to make sure that each student was accounted for on each day which involved calling up parents to ask about the students' whereabouts if they hadn't notified the school ahead of time via texts, website, or answering machine.

		Here I was able to obtain work-experience with electronics while a new electronics technician was sought.
		My tasks included populating printed circuit boards with emphasis being on consistency, taking inventory for upcoming orders, and working with a client to determine their exact requirement for their custom hardware which I was then responsible for constructing.
  </p>
	<p>
		This latter responsibility was one that I found particular interesting because I got the opportunity to work with Arduino and learn about some of its quirks.
		In this specific instance we needed to have analogue temperature sensors as far as feasible from a power supply box.
		The sensors, in this case, output a signal in tens of millivolts increasing linearly with temperature.
		The issue that I ran into was that the Arduino Duo measures voltage via a capacitor and the initial length of the cable, combined with the low signal amplitude, made the Arduino give faulty readings.
		The cable itself was acting as enough of a capacitor to offset the readings.
		The solution, therefore, was to reduce the length of the cable, which was simple enough.

	  Here I was worked as a demonstrator for PHSI191: Biological Physics; a introductory physics paper required to be taken as part of the first year of health science at University of Otago.
	  The main difference between this teach laboratory experience and my previous is that those taking the class were doing so by requirement rather than preference.

		In this position I had the opportunity to gain hands on experience with a variety of technologies related to research.
		It was also an exciting position in that it was the first time I was able to put the theory I had been learning into practical application.
		I was also able to, and expected to, learn various new technologies ancillary to the work being done.
		In many cases this was a result of delegation to enable other members of the group to focus on their research and other tasks unique to their abilities.
		Taking responsibility for organising the weekly literature review meetings of the group is one example of this.

	<p>
		This was a position I took up while studying towards my Bachelor of Science at University of Puget Sound.
		Here I worked with the professor teaching the class to make sure that the students were able to complete their laboratories safely while also ensuring that said students understood the experiments.
		These laboratories were typically 5 tables of up to 6 students working together with widely varied academic backgrounds and experience levels.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the advantages to this arrangement is that I, as the teaching assistant, was able to practice explaining technical concepts and confirm what I needed to revise thus solidifying my knowledge.

		My task in this position was to take open-ended data recorded in questionnaires by experiment participants and convert it into numerical data in a spreadsheet for those running the experiment.
		The open-ended data here was the job title participants reported themselves as having.
		These reported job titles were compared with those recorded in the New Zealand census, which also gave the relevant conversions to the numerical values desired by the experimenters.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was interesting for me in that much of what I was doing was subject to interpretation.
		What this meant was that I had to learn about ways of ensuring that my interpretations of the given data would be the same as those that the experimenters themselves would have made.
		The main technique for this was each of us doing the same section of data and measuring the rate of agreement between us.
