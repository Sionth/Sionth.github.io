	This programme was designed to provide students that had already completed an undergraduate degree with the functional equivalent of a major in computer science.
	The programme took place over the course of just over a year; two summer semesters, a spring semester, and a fall semester.
	Personal highlights of the programme, for me, were the artificial intelligence paper that went over various common applications of machine learning and the game development and software engineering papers where I was able to learn more about the product development life-cycle.
</p>
<p>
	I think learning about the project development lifecycle, especially the advantages and disadvantages of various common approaches, was especially useful for me because this was not omething I had formally engaged with since high school.

	This masters program was designed with the goal of getting science graduates prepared for working in industry.
	They tried to do this by teaching skills desired by those in industry and, in place of a thesis, three reports over the course of a nine-month internship.
</p>
<p>
	In my case I managed to organise a fixed-term research assistantship at the University of Otago in one of their quantum optics research groups.
	Details about this can be found later on this page.
	One of the key skills I developed here, in addition to learning various new technologies, was keeping intellectual property concerns in mind while writing my reports back to University of Oregon about what I was working on.

<p>
	One of the things that made my time at UPS special was the requirement that we take classes outside of our majors.
	This took the form of taking two from a handful of papers during my first year as well as at least one paper from the categories of maths, physical sciences, social sciences, fine arts, and humanities.
	We also had a foreign language requirement and an upper division (300-level or higher) paper outside of our major.
</p>
<p>
	On the whole, I enjoyed this.
	The favourite subject this turned me onto was Science, Technology, and Society.
	As the name implies, the STS department were interested in the roles that science and technology take in society and their influence on its development.
	The papers I took focused the history of science and its controversies.
