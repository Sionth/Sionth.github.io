      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Supported a quantum optics research group with their research</li>
        <li>Organised weekly literature review meetings by maintaining scheduling information on the group website and communicating with each week's speaker</li>
        <li>Recommended improvements to the existing cryostat design using physical models to compensate for missing information.
        <li>Utilised SolidWorks to diagram and preview the changes required for these improvements</li>
        <li>Measured the linewidth of an important laser to determine experimental precision</li>
        <li>Researched and advised on optical second harmonic generation materials and techniques for a specific product.</li>
        <li>Parsed 4 years of data from local SQL database using Matlab to generate plots for quick reference.</li>
        <li>Utilised Blender to diagram an experimental component for publication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this position I had the opportunity to gain hands on experience with a variety of technologies related to research.
        It was also an exciting position in that it was the first time I was able to put the theory I had been learning into practical application.
        I was also able to, and expected to, learn various new technologies ancillary to the work being done.
        In many cases this was a result of delegation to enable other members of the group to focus on their research and other tasks unique to their abilities.
        Taking responsibility for organising the weekly literature review meetings of the group is one example of this.

    <div class = "content">
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Encoded self-reported demographic data for a child development study using NZ census classifications</li>
        <li>Transcribed parent-child conversation to better understand language development in young children.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My task in this position was to take open-ended data recorded in questionnaires by experiment participants and convert it into numerical data in a spreadsheet for those running the experiment.
        The open-ended data here was the job title participants reported themselves as having.
        These reported job titles were compared with those recorded in the New Zealand census, which also gave the relevant conversions to the numerical values desired by the experimenters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was interesting for me in that much of what I was doing was subject to interpretation.
        What this meant was that I had to learn about ways of ensuring that my interpretations of the given data would be the same as those that the experimenters themselves would have made.
        The main technique for this was each of us doing the same section of data and measuring the rate of agreement between us.

    <h2>Collaborative Experiences</h2>

      These are projects in which I worked with others towards a final goal.

    <button type = "button" class = "collapsible">Computer Game Design Class Project</button>
    <div class = "content">
      <p>
        This was a project I worked on with two others over the course of 5 weeks.
        I have preserved the initial form of it <a href = "/projects/Alchemaster/">here</a> but you should also be able to view it on the course website <a href = "http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc360/game-projects-alchemaster.php">here</a>.
        Because the other two members of the group were proficient in different kinds of art I was one of the main programmers for the project.
        In particular I took responsibility for the behaviour of the enemies in the game with the pathfinding being easily one of the most interesting aspects.
        I also took partial responsibility for the User Interface design as I was the member of the group most experienced with the genre of game we were creating - tower defence - which also meant that I naturally was given partial responsibility for checking the balance of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pathfinding was interesting because the technique we had learned for pathfinding was among the best for a low number of actors, especially when destinations needed to be recalculated frequently.
        This method, the A* method, has each actor probe possible moves, preferring the shortest path towards the target that it has thus far explored.
        I knew that we would have many many actors on the screen at once, meaning that any way to reduce their need to think would be greatly valuable.
        Further, our game had player-created mazes being constructed while enemies were moving towards a static goal location.
        The long mazes meant that there was a long path to calculate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution I arrived at, after discussing the project with a friend with greater experience in the field, was to use flow maps.
        In this case the map itself calculates the distance a given tile is from the goal.
        The downside is that the entirety of the map must be explored to determine its distance from the goal, but the upside is that this only needs to happen once per update.
        For enemies this is much faster since they simply need to look at the tiles adjacent to them and move towards the one with the lowest distance to the goal.
        An additional advantage to this technique is that it enabled us to tell if there were areas of the map that were blocked off thus impossible to navigate from.
        This allowed us to prevent actions that would cause this situation.
